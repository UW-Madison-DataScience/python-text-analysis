## Is text analysis artificial intelligence? 

Artificial intelligence is loosely defined as the ability for computer systems to perform tasks that have traditionally required human reasoning and perception. 
* To the extent that text analysis performs a task that resembles reading, understanding, and analyzing meaning, it can be understood to be part of the definition of artificial intelligence. 


In an October 2022 webinar on AI and publishing, Lucy Lu Wang (LLW), Assistant Professor at the University of Washington Information School described AI, saying, "Recently, AI mostly refers to models learned directly from data, rather than explicitly encoding human knowledge in a structured way." 
* The methods in this lesson all demonstrate models that learn from data - specifically, from text corpora that are not structured to explicitly tell the machine anything other than, perhaps, title, author, date, and body of text.
(why is this important?)
