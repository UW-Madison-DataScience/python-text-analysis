##Key Concepts for Text Analysis

Practioners of digital humanities often employ text analysis to look for patterns across a single text, or across a corpus of text that may be too large for a single human to read. Python includes several libraries that address text analysis, including nltk and sci-kit. Before we get to those, we'll discuss some fundamental concepts of text analysis, especially as they relate to pre-processing of the text (to make it amenable to analysis) and the methods and limitations of some common methods. 

###Tokenization

Tokenization is the process of breaking down texts (strings of characters) into words, groups of words, and sentences. A string of characters needs to be understood by a program as words, or even terms made up of more than one word.
