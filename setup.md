## Download the helpers.py file
This file contains helper functions that we'll use throughout the workshop. Click the link below to download it, and place it into a new folder called "text-analysis" on your Desktop (e.g., `/Users/username/Desktop/text-analysis/helpers.py`)
* [helpers.py](code/helpers.py)

## Google Colab Setup 
We will be using [Google Colab](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html) to run Python code in our browsers. Colab was chosen to ensure all learners have similar processing power (using Google's servers), and to streamline the setup required for the workshop. If you prefer to setup a local environment and download all necessary packages, please review the next section. However, please ensure that machine has at least [FIXME] GB of RAM (otherwise your code may run slower than the rest of the learners).

1. Visit the [Google Colab website](https://colab.research.google.com/) and click "New notebook" from the pop-up that shows up
2. Visit [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/my-drive) and find a newly created "Colab Notebooks" folder stored under MyDrive, ```/My Drive/Colab Notebooks```
3. Upload the text-analysis folder created on your Desktop earlier: ```/My Drive/Colab Notebooks/text-analysis/```
4. **Note for instructors**: At the start of each section, create a new Colab file within the text-analysis folder by navigating to ```/My Drive/Colab Notebooks/text-analysis/``` within [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/my-drive), followed by clicking ```New -> More -> Google Colaboratory```
